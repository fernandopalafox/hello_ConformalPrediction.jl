# Resources

- [Patrick Altmeyer's Blog con Conformal Prediction](https://www.paltmeyer.com/blog/posts/conformal-prediction/). Followed this for the most part.

# What is this? 
This repo is part of a series where I familiarize myself with a new package, library, or technique. 
To follow along, start a Julia REPL in the root of this repo and type:
```julia
julia> ] instantiate
julia> include("experiment/{experiment_name}.jl")
```
